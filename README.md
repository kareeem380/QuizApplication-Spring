# QuizApplication-Spring

The Quiz Application using SpringBoot and JSP JSTL is a web-based platform designed to facilitate quizzes for both students and professors.

Students would use the platform to take quizzes, track their performance, and view their progress over time. Professors, on the other hand, would use the platform to create and manage quizzes, as well as monitor their students' performance.

The application likely includes a user authentication system to ensure that only authorized users (i.e., students and professors) can access the quizzes and related data. Professors would have the ability to create new quizzes, assign them to specific classes or groups of students, and track their students' progress on the quizzes. Students would be able to take quizzes, view their scores, and track their progress over time.

Overall, the Quiz Application using SpringBoot and JSP JSTL sounds like a valuable tool for both students and professors, providing a convenient and efficient way to create, manage, and take quizzes online.
